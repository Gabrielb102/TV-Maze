Howdy, this is my TV maze assignment, which was completed after receiving some help in office hours. It all works fine, but there are some flaws. I limited the episodes section to just ten episodes, keeping in mind that some shows have 100+ episodes. The intention was to add a "see more" button, but I'm behind as it is. The episodes buttons all work, but they toggle the episodes area regardless of whether or not a different show is selected. Thank you everyone.
